# Learning Tailwind CSS

Things I've learned immediately as I'm 1 minute into a tutorial:

- It's not like Bootstrap or Vuetify in that it doesn't come with pre-built components, it's just a huge amount of CSS classes, so you make things yourself.

- It does cool things like dead code elimination, removing any CSS you aren't actually using.
